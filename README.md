# Snov.io Sales Automation Platform: Unlimited Email Campaigns, 7-Tier Verification, Free CRM

So here's the thing about sales automation tools — most of them promise you the moon but deliver a glorified contact list and maybe a rickety email sender that works on Tuesdays. Then there's Snov.io, this Ukrainian-born platform that's been quietly helping over 185,000 companies actually close deals instead of just collecting digital business cards.

I spent some time digging into what makes this thing tick, and honestly? It's one of those rare cases where the tool does what it says on the tin, without making you feel like you need a PhD in software engineering to figure it out.

## What Actually Is Snov.io?

Think of it as your sales team's Swiss Army knife. You've got email finding, verification, cold outreach automation, LinkedIn tools, email warm-up, and a CRM — all living under one roof. No more juggling twelve different subscriptions and trying to remember which password goes where.

The platform launched back in 2017, and they've been adding features at a pretty impressive clip. The latest additions include AI-powered email generation and some clever LinkedIn automation that doesn't get your account banned (which, let's be honest, is a legitimate concern these days).

## The Pricing Breakdown: What You Actually Get

Let me lay out the numbers because this is where things get interesting. Snov.io uses annual billing with a 25% discount, and the pricing structure is actually pretty straightforward once you understand their credit system.

### Pricing Comparison Table

| Plan | Monthly Price (Annual) | Credits | Recipients | Email Warm-ups | Best For |
|------|----------------------|---------|-----------|---------------|----------|
| **Trial** |  [Free](https://snov.io) | 50 | 100 | 1 (450 emails one-time) | Testing the platform |
| **Starter** |  [$29.25/mo](https://snov.io) | 1,000 | 5,000 | 3 | Solo entrepreneurs, small teams |
| **Pro S** |  [$74.25/mo](https://snov.io) | 5,000 | 25,000 | Unlimited | Growing sales teams |
| **Pro M** |  [$149/mo](https://snov.io) | 20,000 | 50,000 | Unlimited | Mid-size teams with volume |
| **Pro L** |  [$297/mo](https://snov.io) | 50,000 | 100,000 | Unlimited | Large-scale operations |
| **Ultra** |  [$594/mo](https://snov.io) | 100,000 | 200,000 | Unlimited | Enterprise teams |
| **Custom Ultra** |  [Contact Sales](https://snov.io) | 200,000+ | 400,000+ | Unlimited | Agencies, top players |

**Note:** LinkedIn Automation costs an additional $69/month per account slot (or $62/month with annual billing - 10% discount).

Here's what makes their pricing model clever: credits work for both finding emails AND verifying them. One credit equals one email search or one verification. So if you're the type who needs to verify a ton of emails, you might burn through credits faster than someone just hunting for new contacts.

Recipients are different — you only get charged once per person you contact in a billing period. All the follow-ups? Free. Unlimited. Which means you can set up those 7-step nurture sequences without watching your budget evaporate.

## The Features That Actually Matter

### Email Finding That Doesn't Suck

The platform gives you multiple ways to hunt down email addresses. You can search their database of 50+ million company profiles using 15 different filters, look up emails by name and domain, or use their Chrome extension to grab contacts from LinkedIn and websites as you browse.

I've seen reports of 75-80% accuracy rates, which is pretty solid for the price point. Sure, you'll hit some dead ends and outdated addresses, but that's where the verification comes in.

### 7-Tier Email Verification

This is where Snov.io flexes a bit. Their verification process checks syntax, MX records, SMTP records, and a bunch of other technical stuff that basically means your emails actually reach real people instead of bouncing into the void.

The verification is fast — you can process up to 100,000 email addresses in bulk. And according to user reviews, it genuinely reduces bounce rates and keeps your sender reputation intact.

### Email Warm-up (Because Cold Starts Are Brutal)

Here's something most people don't think about until it's too late: if you suddenly start blasting emails from a brand new account, email providers will side-eye you hard. Your emails land in spam, and you're done.

Snov.io's warm-up feature gradually builds your sender reputation by simulating realistic email conversations. On the Trial plan, you get one warm-up slot with about 15 messages per day. The Starter plan bumps that to 3 slots with 50 messages per day. Pro plans? Unlimited warm-ups with up to 1,000 messages per mailbox per day.

Users consistently report better inbox placement after following the recommended warm-up periods. 👉 [Start warming up your emails](https://snov.io)

### Drip Campaigns Without the Headache

The campaign builder uses a visual, drag-and-drop interface. You can create multi-step sequences with behavioral triggers (if they opened, if they clicked), A/B test your subject lines, and set up different paths based on how people respond.

All paid plans include unlimited campaigns, unlimited follow-ups, and unlimited sender accounts. Your only limit is the number of recipients in your plan. The platform supports Gmail, Google Workspace, Outlook, Exchange, and custom SMTP setups.

One reviewer mentioned hitting 35% response rates after warming up their mailboxes properly. Another reported 40% open rates consistently. Those aren't lottery numbers — they're what happens when you actually set things up right.

### LinkedIn Automation (The Safe Kind)

LinkedIn automation is tricky because LinkedIn doesn't exactly love bots crawling their platform. Snov.io handles this with location-based proxies, safe daily action limits, and a warm-up mode specifically for LinkedIn accounts.

You can automate connection requests, messages, InMail, profile views, and post likes. The system tracks your Social Selling Index score and automatically adjusts to keep you safe.

The catch? This is a paid add-on at $69 per account slot per month (or $62/month with annual billing). Each slot includes dedicated proxies and IP rotation. 👉 [Explore LinkedIn automation](https://snov.io)

### The Free CRM Nobody Talks About

Every plan — including the free Trial — comes with a basic CRM. You get 20 pipelines with up to 100 stages each, space for 10,000 active deals, and 200 custom fields.

It's not going to replace Salesforce for complex workflows, but for straightforward deal tracking and task management? It works. You can sync with Google Calendar, leave notes for teammates, and track why deals fall through.

## What Users Actually Say

I dug through hundreds of reviews on G2, Capterra, Trustpilot, and Product Hunt. Here's the honest picture:

**The Good Stuff:**
- Support team is crazy responsive. Multiple people mentioned getting help within minutes via 24/7 chat
- The interface makes sense. Even people who aren't tech-savvy can figure it out
- The email finder and verification combo saves hours of manual work
- Pricing is fair compared to competitors, especially when you factor in the free CRM
- Regular feature updates keep the platform improving

**The Not-So-Good Stuff:**
- Some email data can be outdated (though this is true for basically every B2B database)
- The CRM is basic — if you need advanced pipeline automation, you'll want something beefier
- LinkedIn automation can be hit-or-miss, and the $69/month add-on cost adds up quickly
- A few users reported technical glitches with campaign sending, though support apparently jumped on fixes

One user summed it up nicely: "Snov.io is decent for building out your account database, but I would stay away from it for managing more than 10 email campaigns." Another countered: "We've increased our contact list by 30%, adding over 40,000 leads from 35 campaigns in just 2023."

Your mileage will vary based on what you're trying to accomplish.

## The Hidden Gems

There are a few features that don't get enough attention:

**AI Email Generator**: The platform includes sales-trained AI tools that help you write better emails. You can improve writing, fix grammar, translate, and adjust tone without leaving the platform.

**Deliverability Check Suite**: Domain health checker, email placement test, spam word detection, blacklist monitoring, and sender reputation scoring. All included. This is the kind of stuff that keeps your emails out of spam folders.

**Magic Pixel Tracking**: Open tracking that doesn't set off spam filters. Clever workaround for a real problem.

**Spintax Support**: Automatically varies your message content so each email looks unique. Helps avoid pattern detection by spam filters.

## Current Promotions and Discounts (2026)

Based on recent searches, here's what's available:

- **Annual Billing Discount**: Automatic 25% off when you pay yearly instead of monthly
- **3-Month Billing**: Save 5% compared to monthly
- **LinkedIn Automation Bundle**: Save 10% on LinkedIn slots with annual billing ($62/mo instead of $69/mo)
- **NachoNacho Partnership**: 20% cashback when subscribing through their marketplace
- **Free Trial**: Renewable every 30 days with 50 credits and 100 recipients - no credit card required

👉 [Check current promotions](https://snov.io)

The best deal? Go annual on the Pro S plan if you're serious about cold outreach. You'll save $297/year and unlock unlimited email warm-ups plus all the advanced features.

## Who Should Actually Use This?

Snov.io makes sense for:

- **Solo entrepreneurs and consultants** running B2B outreach on a budget
- **Small sales teams** (5-20 people) who need to generate leads and automate follow-ups
- **Lead generation agencies** managing campaigns for multiple clients
- **Startups** building prospect lists from scratch without burning venture capital

It's probably NOT the best fit if:

- You need an enterprise-grade CRM with complex automation workflows
- You're doing primarily B2C marketing (this is built for B2B)
- You need phone numbers (Snov.io focuses on email addresses)
- You're looking for extensive integrations beyond the basics

## The Bottom Line

Snov.io isn't trying to be everything to everyone. It's a solid, reasonably-priced sales automation platform that does the core jobs well: finding emails, verifying them, warming up your accounts, and automating outreach campaigns.

The free CRM is a nice bonus. The support team actually helps. The interface won't make you want to throw your laptop out the window. And the pricing is transparent enough that you won't feel like you're getting nickel-and-dimed every time you turn around.

Is it perfect? No. The database has some outdated entries. The LinkedIn automation costs extra. The CRM is basic. But for most small to mid-size B2B teams, these aren't deal-breakers.

If you're tired of juggling multiple tools and just want something that works, 👉 [give the free trial a shot](https://snov.io). You've got nothing to lose — no credit card required, and it renews every 30 days.

Just don't expect miracles. This is a tool, not a magic wand. You still have to write decent emails, target the right people, and follow up consistently. But if you're willing to put in that work, Snov.io will make the execution a whole lot easier.
